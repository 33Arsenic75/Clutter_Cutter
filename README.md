This program will sort all the files in a folder based upon its file name. For example files having similar file name like MTL1 and MTL2 will be sorted into same folder. The idea of similar names depends upon an integer input. Like if we take the integer input as 3, Then the files having first 3 characters same will be sorted into the same folder. We also take another input as on which folder to apply this function. For example, if we apply this bot on a folder name "Semester1". So we need to provide the folder address as another input. This bot constantly runs and sorts the files added in the folder into another folder. The method of adding a file in this folder is to "move" the file to the above folder. If we "cut" and "paste" the file, the bot will show a promt but will still sort the file properly and continue running. This program will help in sorting large number of file which would otherwise be a nightmare.
